### ‚ùì **ASK** ‚Äî The Big Picture
This project aims to help the bank's marketing team launch a more effective ad campaign. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, we will use **customer segmentation** to group customers with similar spending behaviors. This allows the marketing team to create tailored campaigns that resonate with each specific group, which is crucial for maximizing conversion rates and increasing profitability.

**Stakeholders**: The primary users of this dashboard are the **Marketing Team** and **Bank Management**. The marketing team will use the insights to design targeted campaigns, while management can monitor customer behavior and the effectiveness of our segmentation strategy.

**Deliverables**: This interactive dashboard serves as the final deliverable, providing a visual and explained overview of our analysis, from raw data to actionable customer groups.
