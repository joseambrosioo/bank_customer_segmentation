### ‚ùì **ASK** ‚Äî The Business Question
This project is designed to help a bank's marketing team move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, we're using **customer segmentation** to group customers with similar spending behaviors. This allows the marketing team to create highly targeted ad campaigns that are more likely to succeed.

**Stakeholders**: The primary audience for this dashboard is the **Marketing Team** and **Bank Management**. The marketing team will use these insights to design specific campaigns, while management can track customer behavior and the success of our segmentation strategy.

**Deliverables**: This interactive dashboard serves as the final deliverable, providing a clear, visual, and explained overview of our analysis, from raw data to actionable customer groups.
